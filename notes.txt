I ran this code using the following environment:

WSL2 - Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS
nodejs v15.13.0 (Require nodejs ^14 to use optional chaining )
yarn 1.22.5
Docker version 20.10.6

To run the project use the included Makefile.

make setup:  builds containerized postgres database, installs packages in root, backend and frontend projects

make server: using concurrently spins up backend project (Express)
             on http://localhost:8081 and the frontend (React) project at http://localhost:8080

make test:   executes backend logic unit tests (Jest)

I had a lot of fun putting this together! Thanks again for your consideration.
